            <p>Hi, I'm Sasha! I'm an undergraduate student at McMaster University majoring in computer science with a minor in statistics, and currently applying for MSc and PhD programs.
               I've been involved with research for over two years now, starting in the <a href="https://machineteaching.ca/">MTHI Group</a> with <a href="https://swati-mishra.com/">Swati Mishra</a>, briefly in the <a href="https://metre.mcmaster.ca/">METRE Lab</a> with <a href="http://joncannon.net/">Jonathan Cannon</a>, and now at the <a href="https://vectorinstitute.ai/">Vector Institute</a> with <a href="https://k-r-allen.github.io/">Kelsey Allen</a>.
               Outside of research, I love reading philosophy and literature, camping and hiking, and photography :)</p>

    <h4>Research Interests</h4>
    <p>
        I am particularly interested in understanding the idiosyncrasies of biological intelligence, and using machine intelligence as a newfound foil to explore my questions.
        How do humans learn and generalize so quickly from such small amounts of data, such as recognizing a giraffe after seeing just one photo?
        Can sufficiently intelligent machines develop and participant in complex social constructs, such as countries or ant colonies?
        Can all forms of intelligence create their own culture? Is all of it as <q>meaningful</q> as ours?
    </p>
    <p>
        What makes these questions so challenging (and exciting) is the depth of abstractions and breadth of interdisciplinary fields required to produce a satisfactory answer.
        On the lowest level, neuroscience and mechanistic interpretability offer us a reductionist perspective into the trillions of synapses and weights used to produce intelligence.
        Above this, cognitive science allows us to examine the fundmental processes of the human mind (e.g., learning, decision-making), analogous to the algorithms machines use to replicate similar effects (e.g., backpropagation, policy optimization).
        At the highest level, psychology, sociology, and even the arts let us make sense of the observable behaviors and expressions these systems exhibit as they interact with our world.
        Each of these strata offer a unique perspective into what intelligence is and what it is not, and to capture a complete picture, we should consider each one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within this huge problem space, I'm excited to apply computational models to empirical studies with both humans and machines&mdash;especially those involving human-AI interactions&mdash;to draw inferences about different social phenomena.
        I'm especially interested in using fun, intuitive environments (e.g., <a href="#sokoban">puzzle-solving games</a>) as a microcosm for studying cognition within controllable lab settings.
        I'm similarly passionate to apply this work by <a href="#storyblocks">building tools</a> that support&mdash;rather than automate&mdash;human thinking and aligning human values with the future of machine intelligence.
        I'm also interested in learning more about computational approaches in neuroscience for modeling brain regions involved in cognition (i.e., the prefrontal cortex).

    </p>
    <p>
        Right now, I am continuing to lead research development with my amazing group&mdash;<a href="https://k-r-allen.github.io/">Kelsey Allen</a> (UBC),
            <a href="https://collinskatie.github.io/">Katie Collins</a> (MIT),
            <a href="https://keremoktar.com/">Kerem Oktar</a> (Meta FAIR),
            and <a href="https://ilia10000.github.io/">Ilia Sucholutsky</a> (NYU)&mdash;by examining game archetypes that involve different types of reasoning to build on our existing work.

                We quantify how large language models (LLMs) exhibit vigilant and persuasive behaviors in paired puzzle-solving tasks with mixed-motive advisors using Sokoban, a spatial reasoning game.
                We find that each model exhibits vastly different social reasoning capabilities (e.g., GPT-5 and Grok 4 have similar puzzle-solving skills, yet diametric vigilance skills), and that, generally, unassisted performance, vigilance, and persuasion are dissociable cognitive facets.

                Combining methods from HCI, cognitive science, and narrative theory, we build StoryBlocks, an interface for supporting data-driven storytelling.
                Our system decomposes data-driven narratives into fundamental components (represented as blocks) and uses several mechanisms to decrease cognitive load, such as a multi-agentic architecture for data exploration and a non-linear environment for narrativization.
                Through user studies, we find that StoryBlocks supports hierarchical planning, reduces bias, and accelerates story creation, while retaining creative control in the hands of writers.
