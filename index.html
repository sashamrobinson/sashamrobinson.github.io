    <h4>Research</h4>
    <p>
        My primary interests lie in improving the social partnership between humans and machines by (1) studying how people engage with existing artificial systems, (2) exploring how to ethically build benevolent agents and integrate them into society, and (3) raising awareness for the existing pitfalls in our current, often problematic, relationship. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Much inspired by my current interests, I am working with <a href="https://k-r-allen.github.io/">Dr. Kelsey Allen</a> <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">(The University of British Columbia)</a>, <a href="https://keremoktar.com/">Dr. Kerem Oktar</a> <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">(Princeton University)</a>, <a href="https://collinskatie.github.io/">Katie Collins</a> <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">(University of Cambridge)</a>, and <a href="https://ilia10000.github.io/">Dr. Ilia Sucholutsky</a> <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">(NYU)</a> on studying the dangers of malicious AI systems by exploring their persuasive capabilities within gamified settings. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Before this, I worked with <a href="http://joncannon.net/">Dr. Jonathan Cannon</a> in the <a href="https://metre.mcmaster.ca/">METRE Lab</a> at McMaster University, where we were interested in creating universally accessible mobile software for rehabilitating walking gait delay in Parkinson’s patients using machine learning algorithms. Before that, I worked with <a href="https://swati-mishra.com/">Dr. Swati Mishra</a> in the <a href="https://machineteaching.ca/">Machine Teaching and Human Intelligence Research Group</a> at McMaster University, where we built software for empowering creative, non-linear narrative design in data-driven storytelling using LLMs and graph solving algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is more transparent than ever before that the rapid rise of artificial intelligence over the past decade has opened a Pandora’s box, composed of equal parts hope and despair for our future. I believe it is now the responsibility of contemporary science to align the development of these systems with human well-being, lest we ourselves risk suffering the fate of a modern Prometheus.

            “That’s why people say that Anaxagoras, Thales and men like that are ‘great philosophers’, but don’t think of them as wise, because they see that they’re clueless about their own best interests. Yes, the things they know are extraordinary and amazing and difficult and marvellous - but useless because they aren’t investigating what’s good for human beings.”

    <h4>Teaching </h4>
    <p>In addition to my research, I have had the opportunity of being a teaching assistant. While my teaching is limited, I loved the experience and want to teach more in the future.</p>
